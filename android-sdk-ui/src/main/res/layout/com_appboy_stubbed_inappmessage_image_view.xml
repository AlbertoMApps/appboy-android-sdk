<!-- Due to this ImageView being nested within a layout and style properties not capable of being
inherited from the layout parent, any ImageView specific properties, like scaleType, cannot be applied to
this ImageView directly from the ViewStub origin xml layout. Thus, any ImageView properties for this
view must be set programmatically post-inflation. This layout must be wrapped in a layout tag
and not a merge tag due to this issue: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29344787/including-views-using-merge-tag-and-viewstub.
